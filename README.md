This is my implementation of a front-end for Northcoders News. It is powered by my back-end implementation which is [hosted on Heroku](https://russ-nc-news-api.herokuapp.com/api)

Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Think something along the lines of Reddit.

Northcoders News has articles which are divided into topics. Each article has user curated ratings and can be up or down voted using the API. Users can also add comments about an article. Comments can also be up or down voted. A user can add comments and remove any comments which they have added.
